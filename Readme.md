## âœ… Installation and Environment Setup

### 1. Git Repository Setup

* Clone the repository.
* Set up a new Conda environment (recommended inside VSCode for ease of visibility).

### 2. Required Files

* `requirements.txt`
* `.gitignore` (based on GitHub Python template)
> Note: If `-e .` fails with `setup.py`, use `pyproject.toml` for newer pip versions.

### 3. Now processor requirements will also start(which were not that required in ml):
//(google colab gpu,system gpu, github codespace gpu etc)
