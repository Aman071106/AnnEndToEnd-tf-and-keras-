# âœ¨ Exited or not: End-to-End DL(ANN using tf and keras) Implementation ðŸ¤–

This project demonstrates a ANN architecture.

---

## âœ… Installation and Environment Setup

### 1. Git Repository Setup

* Clone the repository.
* Set up a new Conda environment (recommended inside VSCode for ease of visibility).

### 2. Required Files

* `requirements.txt`
* `.gitignore` (based on GitHub Python template)
> Note: If `-e .` fails with `setup.py`, use `pyproject.toml` for newer pip versions.

### 3. Now processor requirements will also start(which were not that required in ml):
//(google colab gpu,system gpu, github codespace gpu etc)
//fe
//ann-
1. sequential model
2. No of trainable parameters= No of weights + No of bias
3. then dense from keras for hidden layers
4. then activation fns
5. then optimisers
6. then tensorboard for logging
7. metrics (classsification)
8. streamlit app and its deployment
